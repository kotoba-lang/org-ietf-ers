;; `kotoba/ers/chain.kotoba` — the evidence-record verdict.
;;
;; The companion to `path_kotoba_parity_test`, which checked whether one
;; document is in one archive. This checks what a whole record CLAIMS.
;;
;; The parity here is against the rules `ers.core/verify` states in its own
;; docstring and implements in its final `let`, driven directly rather than
;; through a full record: building real RFC 3161 tokens for a hash-renewed
;; multi-chain record would test the TSA plumbing, which is the host's and
;; already has its own tests. What is under test is the VERDICT — and the
;; verdict is computed from per-stamp results, which is exactly what the
;; guest is handed.
;;
;; `.cljc` stays the oracle for the rules and is not required from the guest
;; (require-graph).
;;
;; ## The negative controls
;;
;; Three of the four rules are about not overclaiming, and every one of them
;; passes on a verifier that reports the confident-sounding answer:
;;
;;   * `the-claim-is-the-earliest-verified-timestamp` — a verifier that
;;     reports the newest date reports the weakest version of what it proved,
;;     and it looks like the strongest;
;;   * `an-unverified-stamps-time-is-not-a-date` — letting one set the claim
;;     would let anyone with a forged token move it;
;;   * `trusted-is-three-valued` — collapsing :unknown into either answer
;;     undoes the distinction rfc3161.core keeps deliberately;
;;   * `an-empty-record-is-not-verified` — no evidence is not good evidence,
;;     and `verify`'s own `(seq flat)` guard exists for this;
;;   * `a-hash-renewal-without-the-data-is-not-verified` — reported, not
;;     skipped, and distinguishable from a signature that failed.
