;; `kotoba/ers/path.kotoba` against `ers.core`'s reduced hash tree.
;;
;; The oracle builds a real tree and extracts a real reduced path; the guest
;; is handed that path and must walk it to the same root, naming which two
;; digests to concatenate and in what order. The host does every digest.
;;
;; `.cljc` stays the oracle and is not required from the guest
;; (require-graph).
;;
;; ## The host loop is the point
;;
;; `walk` hands the guest a path and a leaf and then does exactly what it is
;; told: while `needs-digest?`, digest `hash-first` ‖ `hash-second` and hand
;; the result back. It never decides an order and never decides when to
;; promote. If the guest asked for the wrong pair, or in the wrong order,
;; the root simply comes out different -- which is what makes
;; `sorting-is-not-optional` a real test rather than an inspection.
;;
;; ## The negative controls
;;
;; `ers.core`'s docstrings name each of these as the thing that turns
;; arithmetic into proof:
;;
;;   * `a-path-that-does-not-mention-the-document-proves-nothing` — without
;;     it, any path reaching the right root verifies any document;
;;   * `sorting-is-not-optional` — §4.2. Skipping it produces an
;;     implementation that only interoperates with itself, and the test
;;     catches it by presenting a pair in the order that is NOT sorted;
;;   * `a-promoted-node-is-not-paired-with-itself` — duplicating would make
;;     two distinct archives with the same last document produce the same
;;     root. That is a forgery, not an inefficiency;
;;   * `mixed-case-hex-is-refused-not-folded` — `'A'` is 0x41 and `'a'` is
;;     0x61, so folding here would hide that the host handed over something
;;     whose sort order is not the octets'.
